# Career Aspirations of Gen-Z

## Overview

This project delves into the career aspirations of Generation Z, aiming to understand the driving factors behind their professional choices and goals. Through a comprehensive analysis of survey data collected via Google Forms, alongside demographic trends, we aim to uncover insights that shed light on the preferences, motivations, and aspirations of Gen-Z individuals as they navigate the evolving job market. The project not only provides valuable insights for educators, employers, and policymakers but also offers a glimpse into the future of the workforce.
